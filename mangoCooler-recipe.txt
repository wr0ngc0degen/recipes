2 large mangoes, as ripe as possible
150 ml semi-skimmed milk
zest and juice of 1 lime
1 handful ice cubes
1 handful fresh mint leaves, plus extra to serve
brown sugar or honey, to taste

Method


Remove the skin and cut the juicy flesh off the mangoes. Place the fruit in a blender or food processor, along with any juice left on the chopping board. Add the milk, lime juice and zest, ice and mint leaves and give it all a good whiz until smooth. Taste, and if you've got a sweet tooth, add a sprinkling of brown sugar or honey and give it another quick whiz. Chill in the fridge before serving, then garnish with a few mint leaves.
